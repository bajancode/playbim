                <p>Barbados (“Bim” to many locals) has more playgrounds than I remembered growing up here, some a bit sketchy but some are true gems.</p> 
                <p>Please add and review playgrounds you’ve come across in Barbados. This is a tiny side project completed as part of a course, so I’m not always able to update it as much as I’d like, but hope it’s useful to you!</p>
            <p>Please remember to follow physical distancing guidelines, and of course I don’t assume any liability for anything that happens at the playground or on this website. Be safe! </p>
