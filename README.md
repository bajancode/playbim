# PlayBim

PlayBim is a full stack app for users to review playgrounds, created because I had a hard time finding good playgrounds for my kid in Barbados. Includes:
* CRUD (Create a playground including uploading photos, Read playgrounds and reviews, Update playgrounds and photos, Delete review or playgrounds)
* User authentication and authorization including passport.js, common security features such as Mongo injections and Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
* MongoDB (NoSQL database)
* Express framework
* Mapbox Geocoding API 
* Flash messages for success and errors
* Heroku deployment
* HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap 5, Node.js, RESTful API
* Responsive web design 

Created as part of coursework with thanks to Colt Steele and the Complete Web Developer Bootcamp community
